!!! - to compute evolutionary rates of clades, I need the most complete phylogeny - so I should compute them with the full tree of John (i.e. without trimming it with the species I have)
I will simply treat the other nodes as other unsampled species...but then count the interactions only of the sampled species (?) not sure

!!! - idea -> trait correlations that deal with biotic and abiotic pressures (insights about it with this system)
